Notes

def abb = arbitrary but balanced


make max force an atribnute of genetics
some creatures able to change speed/direction faster than other
rather than purely based on their topspeed

make size and attribute of genetics

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

need to add check to ensure grid size will work with cell Size
problem with gaining mass
add color object to creature and remove display methods in moab and predator

POSSIBLE ADD-ONS
memory of food/water points
have preds fight each other to enable pred reduction and gain sense of territory ownership
add objects that block moven=ment
add option to fit grid to screen
fix predator detection range
currently not fleeing until half the distance that they detect food
to add
bouncing     nonpassable creatures
averages
movement based off mouse click and drag
mito
herding
terrain and neural networks
grazing on grass terain insead of finding food for moabs and mito
